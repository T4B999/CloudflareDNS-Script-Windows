# CloudflareDNS-Script-Windows
batch script simplifies the process of configuring your computer's IPv4 DNS settings to use Cloudflare's secure and fast DNS servers (1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1).

Please follow these steps:


- Download the CloudflareDNS-Ethernet.bat or CloudflareDNS-Wi-Fi.bat, depending on the type of adapter you use.
* Run the batch file with administrator privileges (right-click the file and choose "Run as administrator").

Make sure to replace "Ethernet" in the script with the name of your network adapter if it's different. This script is designed to work with a network adapter named "Ethernet" by default, so modify it to match your specific adapter name if needed. added new CloudflareDNS-Wi-Fi.bat for Wi-Fi for users 


I wrote this script for fun, and  not officially maintained by Cloudflare. For more information about Cloudflare, you can visit their website at [https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/)

Please note that I do not take any responsibility for any damage that may occur while using this script.
